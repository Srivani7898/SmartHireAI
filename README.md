## 🔍 Algorithm Details

### S-BERT (Sentence-BERT)
- Uses pre-trained \`all-MiniLM-L6-v2\` model for generating sentence embeddings
- Converts job descriptions and resumes into high-dimensional vectors
- Captures semantic meaning beyond simple keyword matching

### Cosine Similarity
- Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors
- Provides similarity scores between 0 (no similarity) and 1 (identical)
- Robust to document length variations

### Weighted Scoring
- **Overall Similarity (40%):** General semantic match
- **Skills Match (30%):** Technical skills alignment
- **Experience Match (20%):** Relevant work experience
- **Education Match (10%):** Educational background fit

## 📊 Features in Detail
